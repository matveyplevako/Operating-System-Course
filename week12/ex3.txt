Bigger buffer leads to much faster transfer.
The difference between small files in general (less than 10MB) is somewhat small due to the majority of the time being used in the disk I/O overhead.
Using the O_SYNC flag leads to slightly slower transfers, due to waiting for the transfer to complete to continue to the next one.
